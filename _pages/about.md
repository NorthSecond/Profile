# Selected Projects

- [An Efficient task scheduler for POSIX compliant and SMP systems based on NuttX RTOS](https://onedrive.yfyang.me/api/raw/?path=/%E6%9C%89%E5%85%B3%E5%B1%95%E7%A4%BA%E6%96%87%E4%BB%B6/CSCC_2023%E7%AD%94%E8%BE%A9%E6%9D%90%E6%96%99.pdf)
  - This is the project for the CSCC 2023. Based on the open-source real-time operating system NuttX Release v12.0.0, we implemented a symmetric and efficient scheduler that each core maintains its own scheduling sequence with the help of the existing kthread and semaphore support for NuttX's SMP support, and tested it in the simulation environment and on the Sony Spresense real machine respectively. I was responsible for algorithm design and implementation, testing in real environment and defending the results.
- [TODO List](https://github.com/LeeAnnJ/Todo-list)
  - A simple TODO list web application, written in  Typescript. This is the course design for our Software Engineering Training course, done in groups. I independently completed the design and writing of the back-end and database of the project, and finished the corresponding testing work.
- [Rust Online Judge](https://github.com/NorthSecond/Rust-OnlineJudge)
  - A toy-level backend for an online judge system, written in Rust. This is the course design for our Rust course, done in groups. As the leader of the group, I was mainly responsible for handling the project structure, writing a part of back-end interfaces and solving some difficult problems.
